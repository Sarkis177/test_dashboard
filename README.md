Test Task: Dashboard for Monitoring API Data
Objective: Create a small dashboard application using React (functional components with hooks) and TypeScript that displays data fetched from a public REST API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts.
Task Description:

1. Setup: Initialize a new React project using Create React App with TypeScript template. Set up basic routing using React Router.
2. Fetch data from the https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts API to display a list of items (e.g., posts, users, comments).
3. Create Components:
   ● A List View component to display the fetched data in a list format. Each list item should display a summary of the data (e.g., title and user for posts).
   ● A Detail View component that displays more detailed information about an item when clicked from the List View.
4. Styling: Use CSS with one of the preprocessors (LESS, SASS, SCSS) to style the components. Ensure the application is visually appealing and displays well on different screen sizes.
5. Routing: Implement basic routing to switch between the List View and Detail View.
6. State Management: Use React hooks for state management.
7. Optional: If time allows, add a simple WebPack customization or an Nginx configuration file with a basic server setup.
   Requirements:
   ● Use functional components and hooks.
   ● Type all components and functions using TypeScript.
   ● Ensure the application is responsive and works across modern browsers.
   ● Your code should be pushed to a Git repository with appropriate commit messages.
   Evaluation Criteria:
   ● Functionality: All features work as expected without errors.
   ● Code Quality: Clean, readable, and well-organized code.
   ● Use of TypeScript: Proper typing is used throughout the application.
   ● Design and Usability: The application should be easy to use and visually appealing.
   ● Git Usage: Proper use of version control with meaningful commit messages.
   This task will help evaluate the candidate’s skills in using React with hooks, TypeScript, API integration, and basic styling and configuration skills. It is also designed to be clear and straightforward to complete within 2 hours.
